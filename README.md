JABBERWOCKY has been engineered to meet the demanding requirements of filament changing units (FCUs) and multicolor changers. Its extruder is purpose-built to handle the rigorous load and unloading cycles of FCUs, utilizing a Bondtech compound drive gear in an offset configuration, paired with dual LDO non-threaded Orbiter gears for precise and reliable filament control.

The system offers a carefully optimized balance of torque and speed, along with increased surface contact on the filament to ensure stability and consistent feeding throughout operation.

Designed for maximum reliability and serviceability, the toolhead features a tool-free, hinged extruder mechanism, allowing for fast, hassle-free maintenance.

Efficient thermal performance is delivered by high static pressure fans, ensuring airflow reaches critical areas, while the Phaetus Conch high-flow hotend enables smooth, consistent extrusion at volumes up to 35 mm³/s.

Kits will be available through LDO Motor's Vendor Channels. Check your favourite vendor for latest availability.


**Acknowledgments and Thank You**

*The Jabberwocky project commenced shortly after the release of ERCF V2 in November, 2022, directly resulting from my contributions to the ERCF development team. I express my gratitude to my team members, particularly MoggieUK, who has been an exceptional ERCF partner, facilitating the exchange of ideas and addressing challenges related to multi-filament and filament-changing units. The realization of this project was contingent upon the substantial research and development support provided by Jason at LDO Motors. We dedicated numerous months to meticulous material selection, conceptual design, and component identification. Thanks to Dr. Róbert Lőrincz’s for technical assistance and comprehensive responses to my inquiries regarding stepper motors interfacing with ERCF proved highly beneficial for this toolhead, as well as for his pioneering work with the Orbiter gears employed within it. Additionally, Fizzy, another ERCF team member, graciously contributed to the wiki page and documentation, simplifying the user guide for assembling the kit. Finally, I would like to acknowledge the invaluable assistance provided by the many beta testers, who were instrumental in numerous revisions, improvements, and testing conducted during the testing phase.*

Happy Printing!
