JABBERWOCKY has been engineered to meet the demanding requirements of filament changing units (FCUs) and multicolor changers. Its extruder is purpose-built to handle the rigorous load and unloading cycles of FCUs, utilizing a Bondtech compound drive gear in an offset configuration, paired with dual LDO non-threaded Orbiter gears for precise and reliable filament control.

The system offers a carefully optimized balance of torque and speed, along with increased surface contact on the filament to ensure stability and consistent feeding throughout operation.

Designed for maximum reliability and serviceability, the toolhead features a tool-free, hinged extruder mechanism, allowing for fast, hassle-free maintenance.

Efficient thermal performance is delivered by high static pressure fans, ensuring airflow reaches critical areas, while the Phaetus Conch high-flow hotend enables smooth, consistent extrusion at volumes up to 35 mmÂ³/s.
